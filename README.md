# Raphael's .vim directory

## tl;dr 
Paste this into a terminal, if you are using Debian or Ubuntu :

``
wget https://github.com/rlustin/.vim/raw/master/bootstrap.sh -O - | sh
``

This will download the config files, and make sure that dependancies are
satisfied (mainly ctags and Meslo font as well as ViM 7.3.

## Longer version & manual install

This is my ViM configuration, containing all my plugins, and my .vimrc file.
It requires ViM 7.3 for the Gundo plugin to work. ViM has to be compiled with
support for python scripting, and shall link against the same libraries
that it has been compiled to (use the  ``ldd`` command for troubleshooting).

I shall warn that I prefer spaces over tabs, and like 2 space indent.
I use Meslo as a font, and you should install ctags to have autocompletion
enabled.

You should simlink the vimrc file to ~/.vimrc, for this configuration to work.

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

After cloning the repo, issue these commands : 

```sh
cd .vim
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

To update the plugins :

```sh
cd .vim
sh update.sh
```
